This repository contains a number of useful dotfiles. I typically keep them
in ~/dotfiles/ and symlink them to my home directory using the makelinks.pl
script.

Directories in the dotfiles repository will be created as necessary. Files
and folders in the root of the repository will have a dot prefixed to their
names.

The .ignore file lists Perl-compatible regular expressions of files to ignore
when creating the links.

Examples
--------

   ~/dotfiles/zshrc           -> ~/.zshrc
   ~/dotfiles/emacs.d/init.el -> ~/.emacs.d/init.el
